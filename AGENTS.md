# vendo-cli

Agent guide for this repo, shared by every coding agent (Codex reads it directly;
Claude Code reads it through `CLAUDE.md` = `@AGENTS.md`). Edit this file, not `CLAUDE.md`.

## Purpose
Standalone TypeScript CLI — "manage your data pipeline from the terminal". Published as the
`vendo` binary. Talks to the pipelines/web API (`/api/v1/*`). **This repo is the canonical and
only active Vendo CLI** — the former in-monorepo `vendo-web-v2/apps/cli` was removed (2026-06-02).

## Stack
- Node ≥ 22, TypeScript 5.9, `commander` 13, `chalk` 5, `cli-table3`, `ora`.
- Build: `tsup` (ESM → `dist/cli.js`) + Node SEA single-executable for standalone binaries.
- Tests: `vitest`. Lint: `eslint` 9. Version: see `package.json`.

## Rust port (`rust/`, Linear project "Vendo CLI in Rust")
The CLI is being ported to Rust one command group at a time (VE-3664 to VE-3669); the TypeScript
CLI in `src/` stays the shipped binary and takes bug fixes only until the switch-over (VE-3669).
- Goal: works exactly like the TypeScript CLI, just faster. `pnpm parity --rust rust/target/debug/vendo`
  compares the two on staging; allowed differences live in `parity/intended-differences.json`.
- `--json` prints the API response verbatim (no key rewriting), so nested `config`/`schedule`/
  `metrics` keys print snake_case where the TS client camelCased them (decided 2026-10-05).
- Stack: clap 4, reqwest (rustls), tokio, serde_json (`preserve_order`), comfy-table, indicatif.
  Toolchain: `rustup` stable (`~/.cargo/bin`); `pnpm rust:test`, `pnpm rust:build`,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` and `cargo fmt` (120 columns, `rust/rustfmt.toml`) from `rust/`.
- Ported so far: login, init, logout, whoami, config, profile, status, doctor, mcp, completions,
  self-update (VE-3665); jobs list/get/cancel/watch/tail and the shared watcher (VE-3666); apps, sources,
  integrations (`int`) and catalog (VE-3667). Keep `rust/Cargo.toml`'s version equal to `package.json`'s.

## Layout (`src/`)
`cli.ts`, `client.ts`, `config.ts`, `identity.ts`, plus `commands/` (21 modules on 2026-10-05 — `ls src/commands` to recount: apps, sources,
integrations, jobs, metrics, models, catalog, dictionary, measurement, pipeline-resource, mcp, login,
logout, init, doctor, status, whoami, profile, config, completions, self-update). Tests in `src/__tests__/`.

## Key commands
- `pnpm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm run test` — `vitest run`
- `pnpm run lint` / `pnpm run lint:fix`
- `pnpm run build` — `tsup` (dev bundle); `pnpm run build:standalone` — SEA binary
- `pnpm parity --profile <staging profile> [--rust <binary>] [--only <prefix>]` — runs every read-only command
  against staging with the TypeScript CLI (and the Rust CLI when given) and reports differences and
  commands that fail today. Needs `pnpm build`. Refuses non-staging URLs. When you add or rename a
  command, classify it in `parity/commands.json` or the run fails. Tests: `pnpm test:parity` (VE-3664).
- `pnpm parity:writes --profile <staging profile> --rust <binary>` — runs the write commands (apps, sources,
  integration refusals) with both CLIs on throwaway webhook apps and sources, compares output, and deletes
  everything it created, also on failure. Point it at a disposable staging workspace ("Vendo CLI test"),
  not one people use (VE-3667).
- Distribution: `install.sh` pulls per-platform binaries from GitHub Releases
  (`vendo-analytics/vendo-cli`); release CI is tag-triggered (`cli-v*`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
